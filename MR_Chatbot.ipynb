However, based on the trends observable in 2021, I can extrapolate three likely emerging trends in sustainable packaging by then:\n","\n","1. **Increased use of bio-based and compostable materials:**  The movement away from petroleum-based plastics was already accelerating in 2021. By 2025, we would likely see a wider adoption and refinement of bioplastics derived from renewable sources like seaweed, mushrooms, and agricultural waste.  Improved compostability and biodegradability, alongside reduced cost and improved performance characteristics, would be key factors driving this trend.\n","\n","2. **Focus on packaging reduction and reuse systems:**  Minimizing packaging material would continue to be a priority.  This would manifest in lighter-weight packaging designs, innovative packaging formats that reduce material use, and a strong push towards reusable packaging systems, including deposit-return schemes and subscription models for reusable containers.  The advancements in digital tracking and logistics would play a crucial role in supporting this.\n","\n","3. **Enhanced transparency and traceability through digital technologies:**  Consumers are increasingly demanding transparency about the environmental impact of products and their packaging.  This trend would likely see greater adoption of blockchain technology and other digital tools to provide detailed information about the sourcing of materials, manufacturing processes, and end-of-life management options.  This increased transparency would also help build consumer trust and drive the adoption of sustainable practices.\n","\n","\n","It's important to note that these are projections based on pre-2021 data, and the actual trends in 2025 may differ due to unforeseen technological advancements, regulatory changes, or shifts in consumer preferences.\n","\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Ensure PROJECT_DIR is set from Cell 1.0 or define it here if running independently\n","\n","sub_directories = [\"data\", \"notebooks\", \"vectorstore\", \"utils\", \"app\"] # 'app' for Streamlit\n","\n","# Create a placeholder requirements.txt (we'll populate it later for deployment)\n","requirements_file = os.path.join(PROJECT_DIR, \"requirements.txt\")\n","if not os.path.exists(requirements_file):\n","    with open(requirements_file, \"w\") as f:\n","        f.write(\"# Google Generative AI and LlamaIndex\\n\")\n","        f.write(\"google-generativeai\\n\")\n","        f.write(\"llama-index>=0.10\\n\")\n","        f.write(\"faiss-cpu\\n\")\n","        f.write(\"# Document Loaders\\n\")\n","        f.write(\"pandas\\n\")\n","        f.write(\"python-docx\\n\")\n","        f.write(\"PyMuPDF\\n\")\n","        f.write(\"# Web App\\n\")\n","        f.write(\"streamlit\\n\")\n","        f.write(\"# Other\\n\")\n","        f.write(\"tiktoken\\n\") # LlamaIndex might still use this for some operations\n","    print(f\"'{requirements_file}' created.\")\n","else:\n","    print(f\"'{requirements_file}' already exists.\")\n","\n","# Create a placeholder .gitignore (useful if you use Git)\n","gitignore_file = os.path.join(PROJECT_DIR, \".gitignore\")\n","if not os.path.exists(gitignore_file):\n","    with open(gitignore_file, \"w\") as f:\n","        f.write(\"# Environment files\\n\")\n","        f.write(\".env\\n\")\n","        f.write(\"*.env\\n\")\n","        f.write(\"\\n# Colab/Jupyter specific\\n\")\n","        f.write(\".ipynb_checkpoints/\\n\")\n","        f.write(\"__pycache__/\\n\")\n","        f.write(\"\\n# Data files (if large or sensitive and you don't want to commit them)\\n\")\n","        f.write(\"# data/\\n\") # Example: uncomment to ignore data folder\n","        f.write(\"\\n# Vectorstore files\\n\")\n","        f.write(\"vectorstore/\\n\") # Usually good to ignore the built index\n","    print(f\"'{gitignore_file}' created.\")\n","else:\n","    print(f\"'{gitignore_file}' already exists.\")\n","\n","# Create a placeholder README.md\n","readme_file = os.path.join(PROJECT_DIR, \"README.md\")\n","if not os.path.exists(readme_file):\n","    with open(readme_file, \"w\") as f:\n","        f.write(\"# My Market AI Assistant Project (using Gemini)\\n\\n\")\n","        f.write(\"This project aims to build an AI assistant for market research insights, powered by Google Gemini.\\n\")\n","    print(f\"'{readme_file}' created.\")\n","else:\n","    print(f\"'{readme_file}' already exists.\")"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"qxfMhBiYBnzY","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1746609631653,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":18,"user":{"displayName":"Steven Yap","userId":"18419937341421954449"}},"outputId":"dd29be0e-204d-486b-ff65-dc101e945f3c"},"execution_count":9,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Directory '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/MR_Chatbot/data' already exists.\n","Directory '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/MR_Chatbot/notebooks' already exists.\n","Directory '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/MR_Chatbot/vectorstore' already exists.\n","Directory '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/MR_Chatbot/utils' already exists.\n","Directory '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/MR_Chatbot/app' already exists.\n","'/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/MR_Chatbot/requirements.txt' already exists.\n","'/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/MR_Chatbot/.gitignore' already exists.\n","'/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/MR_Chatbot/README.md' already exists.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Cell 1.5 (Run this only if you want to use Git)\n","\n","# Configure Git (only need to do this once per Colab session if not persisted)\n","!git config --global user.name \"stimmarine\"\n","!git config --global user.email \"stevenyap2357@gmail.com\"\n","\n","# Navigate to your project directory (ensure this is correct)\n","os.chdir(PROJECT_DIR) # PROJECT_DIR should be set from Cell 1.0\n","print(f\"Current directory for Git operations: {os.getcwd()}\")\n","\n","# Initialize Git, add files, commit, and push\n","!git init\n","!git add .\n","!git commit -m \"Phase 1: Initial project setup with Gemini and Colab environment\"\n","!git remote add origin https://github.com/stimmarine/MR_Chatbot.git\n","!git branch -M main\n","!git push -u origin main\n","\n","print(\"Git commands executed.
